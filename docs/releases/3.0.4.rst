3.0.4 Release Notes
===================

Channels 3.0.4 is a bugfix release in the 3.0 series.


Bugfixes & Small Changes
------------------------

* Usage of ``urlparse`` in ``OriginValidator`` is corrected to maintain
  compatibility with recent point-releases of Python.

* The import of ``django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser`` in
  ``channels.auth`` is deferred until runtime, in order to avoid errors if
  ``AuthMiddleware`` or ``AuthMiddlewareStack`` were imported before
  ``django.setup()`` was run.

* ``CookieMiddleware`` adds support for the ``samesite`` flag.

* ``WebsocketConsumer.init()`` and ``AsyncWebsocketConsumer.init()`` no longer
  make a bad `super()` call to ``object.init()``.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
